# Vector-manipulation

In this lab, you will have the opportunity to practice once again with the NumPy library. This time, we will explore some advanced operations with arrays and matrices.

At the end of the previous module, we used PCA to transform a set of many variables into a set of only two uncorrelated variables. This process was made through a transformation of the data called rotation. 

In this week's assignment, you will need to find a transformation matrix from English to French vector space embeddings. Such a transformation matrix is nothing else but a matrix that rotates and scales vector spaces.
